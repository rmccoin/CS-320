# CS-320

I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by following the reuirements and running tests that provide a high coverage percentage.  During this class to acheive this goal I had to re-run my JUNIT tests over and over and editing and changing my tests  so that I could finally get high coverage.  To interpret user needs to incorporate them into a program you need to breaking them down to understand how they will work in the program.  During this course, each assignment was given with a set of requirements that needed to be included.  These requirements included maximum character lengths, an object not being equal to null, or even an object not being allowed to change.  Incorporating these requirements into the program is what the user expects and will determine the outcome for the system.  These requirements also give you a baseline to follow when developing the program so that you know what it needs to include and what it will do.  To approach designing a software I first take the requirement and other information that I need to follow and study what the program needs and what it is supposed to do.  I then can break the requirements up by class, and determine what each will include.  In each class I will create a list of objects and funtions.  I will also create test classes so that each time a function is set, I can test it to make sure that I am staying on track along the way and can avoid errors beforehand.
